I'm a middle-aged software engineer living in London, making a living out of
solving other people's Big Data problems. I use Java, Perl, and Python
to do this, but will pretty much deal with anything else provided it's not PHP.

I firmly believe there is no life outside zone 1, which is where I dwell most
of the time, taking [photos][3] and sometimes recording the sounds of the city
in the hopes I will one day be able to spend some real time working them into
[something audible][4].

What I write about here focuses mostly on technology and [programming][5]; I
have a passing interest in usability and web design but am not good enough to
write anything useful on the subjects, so when I do touch them it's mostly
rambling and ranting.

By the way, if I happen to be employed by someone at any given time, these
opinions are my own alone, and don't reflect those of my employer etc etc.
