# Me

Your host's name is Pedro Figueiredo. I'm a middle-aged software engineer
living in London, making a living out of solving other people's Big Data
problems (which sometimes is that they don't have a Big Data problem). I use
Java, Perl, and Python to do this, but will pretty much deal with anything else
provided it's not PHP.

I like distributed systems, high volume/high availability systems, and
monitoring stuff, not necessarily in that order. I'm also an avid gamer these
days, after relapsing and never recovering a few years ago.

I spend a lot of time wandering around London taking [photos][3], and sometimes
recording the sounds of the city in the hopes I will one day be able to spend
some real time working them into [something audible][4].

# This blog

What I write about here focuses mostly on technology and software development;
I have a passing interest in usability and web design but am not good enough to
write anything useful on the subjects, so when I do touch them it's mostly
rambling and ranting.

By the way, if I happen to be employed by someone at any given time, these
opinions are my own alone, and don't reflect those of my employer etc etc.
